# Paycheck-Protection-Program-_SBA-USA
PPP stands for Paycheck Protection Program. This progam was created by US government in order to protect US business and supports US Citizen. To keep the employement they bring this program where business can take loan with very minimum interest, and if they continue current payroll and does not lay off employee during covid then that amount multiply by 2.5 would be wave of from the loan. 
This was the biggest support for the business. So I thought to make analysis , so I got the data from SBA website, did some basic cleaning and dataset and created dashboard for anlaysis.
PPP Program  to support business during Covid -19 by government under SBA Loan
The tableau dashboard helps the user to understand which were the top lenders under the PPP program.
It also helps the user to understand which Loan range has the highest Number of approval.
It has state wise analysis aswell, it shows that California has the highest PPP Loan Approval.
